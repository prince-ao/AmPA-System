- Create a 3 way system where the three players are pet owners, shelters, and animal control officers. The pet owners registers to the app/website and they can
  either browse for lost pets found around their area, or enter a request of a lost pet with a picture of the pet along with other indetifiers. The shelter sees
  all these requests and is able to notify the owner if it is in their inventory, also there will be a systems that helps with this inventory matching, the shelter
  also maintains the current inventory. On the animal control officer side, when he finds a pet he notifies everyone in that range that pet, if someone made a prior
  request for that pet he is able to message that owner, else he brings the pet to a shelter.
